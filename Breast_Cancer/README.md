# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify tumors as
**Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** using a Random Forest Classifier.  
The model achieves over 95% accuracy after feature scaling and training.

## 📂 Files in this Project
- breast-cancer.csv → Dataset file (from Kaggle)
- breast_cancer_ml.py → Python script for training & testing the model
- README.txt → Instructions to run the project

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed and the following libraries:


## ▶️ Steps to Run in VS Code
1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Open the project folder `S:\BrainyBeam\Breast_Cancer` in VS Code.
3. Place both `breast_cancer_ml.py` and `breast-cancer.csv` inside the same folder.
4. Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + `).
5. Run the script:


## ✅ Output
The script will display:
- Model Accuracy (expected ~96–99%)
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Confusion Matrix

## 🚀 Notes
- If you face file path issues, use **forward slashes ( / )** or **raw string paths** in Python.
